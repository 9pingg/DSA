1) A static int variable remains in memory while the program is running. A normal or auto variable is destroyed when a function call where the variable was declared is over. 
2) only intialized once (ONLY ONCE) (if no val given ini to 0)
3) Static variables are allocated memory in the data segment, not the stack segment. See the memory layout of C programs for details.
4) Static variables should not be declared inside a structure, as structure are continous in nature
though it is possible for entire structure to be static
5) static data members do not contribute in size of an object. 
Static local variable (defined inside a class)= class variable 
Visibility: inside class
Lifetime: till termination of program (can be used everytime class is called)
Default value:0
Storage: data segment

Local Variable
Visibility: class
Lifetime: until execution of class
Default value:garbage
Storage:stack

Global variable
Visibility: file
Lifetime: till termination of program
Default value:0
Storage: data segment

static function Visibility is only in file, global functions can be accesesd from other files.
