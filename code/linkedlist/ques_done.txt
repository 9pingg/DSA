1) representation of linked list

2) merge two sorted linked list
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists

3) Remove Duplicates from Sorted List (cmp 2 elements) (itr.next)
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/

4) remove by value


5) reverse a list (itr) (rec)
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/

6) middle of linked list (2 approach) (fast and slow)
https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list

7) remove the nth node from the end of the linked list (fast and slow p, improve t from o(2n) to o(n)) 

8) remove a node by modifying it (O(1) soln)
https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/

9) add two numbers (very similar to merge two sorted list)
https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

10) Intersection of Two Linked Lists
https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/

11) cycle linked list (s and f pointers dont start at same pos though)

12) palindrome linked list (3 concepts used middle, reverse and compare two lists)

13) reorder list (same as palindrome question almost) (has concepts of 3 prev ques) (middle, rev, merge list)
LINKED LIST and ARRAY
https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/

14) rotate list (not easy requires concepts from prev ques : find nth node)
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/

15) flattening of list
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/flattening-a-linked-list/

16) linked list cycle entry point (two pointers) (hashing) (math)
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii

17) merge k sorted lists (same question as flatten linked list)
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists

18) Max Consecutive Ones
