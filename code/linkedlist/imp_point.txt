when removing an element always check for base case pos == 0
also the loop condition is generally while itr.next: in this case

think about fast and slow pointer, they are used in many solns eg: middle of list, remove nth node from end, and many more

remember we add a dummy node to head, in the nth node remove question

generally in question involving cycle or common nodes hashing can be used: intersection of list, cycle in list








string important functions

1) stoi(), stoll() converts string to long long
2) max(string a, string b) max function could be used to compare strings like "123", "132" it returns "132"
3) delete a particular index s.erase(s.begin() + pos)
4)  str.substr(pos, len)
Copying of string starts from pos and is done till pos+len means [pos, pos+len).
"12345678" and we need two substrings such that 4 is removed "123" and "5678"
do this : (WRONG) s.substr(s.begin(), s.begin()+3) + s.substr(s.begin()+4, s.end()) or just s.substr(s.begin()+4)

NOTE: substr doesnt take iterators

So, instead of s.begin() just put 0 s.substr(0, 0+3) + s.substr(0+4, s.end()) or just s.substr(0+4)
