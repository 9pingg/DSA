A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way 
that is easy to navigate and search. so complexity of seach and iterate is less than linear structures like list. 

binary trees have at max 2 child nodes.

tree: search, del, ins O(log(n))
list: search o(n), ins and del o(1) when it known
hash table: all o(1) if no collisions

so tree is avg in all, but is best for heirarchical data and when data needs to be searched
used in set(bst) multiset (rb), and map(rb)

BST: binary search tree, bt with some order. generally all nodes left of root are less in value, and right nodes are more in value.
It has no duplicates.
In this we reduce search space by half everytime so search complexity is o(logn)

2 ways of searching 
1) bfs
2) dfs
    (position of left and right remain same, just the position of root node changes)
    2.1 inorder search l root r
    2.2 preoder search root l r 
    2.3 postorder search l r root

difference between heap and bst:

1) heap is a complete binary tree (all leaf nodes at same level, and filled left to right)
2) heap is not ordered like bst
3) heap can have duplicate items but bst cannot
4) inserting in bst can take max o(n) or o(h) if bst is chain like, but in heap it is always o(log(n))
5) heapify is o(n). building a heap takes on o(n) from random n elements, but inserting an element to a heap takes log(n) just like bst
