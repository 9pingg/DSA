1) whenerver update is to be made in tree always make updates root.left = temp, not like this root = temp 

2) bst search, del, ins is o(h) h = height of the tree

3) set is binary search tree and multiset is self balancing bst

4) inorder traversal of bst = get values in sorted order

5) all traversals are o(n) and s: o(h)

6) travesal: vertical, bottom, and top are based on lines (divide nodes by columns) (modified queue entry) 

7) when nodes are to be appended in a list, such that bottom nodes appear earlier in list. use recursion go root.left 
   till none, then add nodes on way back to the root

8) MAX WIDTH QUE have queue_node (modified queue entry)
